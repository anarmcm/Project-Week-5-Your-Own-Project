## Project Description
The project analyses the degree of attendance in online courses and the relationship between course duration and attendance. I had the feeling that completing online courses was difficult, due to lack of time or motivation, and wanted to find out if not finishing an online course was related to course duration. 

## Questions & Hypotheses
- Do people finish the courses they start? I felt that the completion rate would be low
- Is attendance related to course duration? I felt that the higher the course duration, the lower the attendance

## Dataset
I worked with a csv I found in kaggle. The csv contains information on total participants per course for Harvard and MIT courses. The data includes the number of people per course who attended more than 50% of the course, and the number of participants who achieved a certification. In the csv there is a column with each courses' duration in total hours. The columns which were relevant for my analysis where: 

- Participants
- % of people who attended more than 50% of the course
- Total hours

## Workflow

- Finding a dataset
- Asking questions and proposing a hypothesis 
- Cleaing the data 
- Descriptive statistics to get a general view of the dataset by doing visualizations
- Finding relationships between variables by using linear regression 
- Concluding if the results after the analysis are in line with my hypothesis 

## Organization

In order to organize my work I used Trello 

The repository cointains my powerpoint final presentation and a file called your-project. Inside your-project I have two files:
- Data: contains the original csv (online_courses.csv) and the new csv after cleaning the data (clean_data.csv) 
- Code: contains two python notebooks, one with code I used to explore the data in general, but which does not give answer to my main questions (code_sketch.ipynb) and a second one with the main code which gives answers to the initail questions (final_code.ipynb)
